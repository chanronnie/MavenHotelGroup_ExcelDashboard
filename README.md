## About this project

**Objective**:<br>
The aim of this project was to assist a colleague from Maven Hotel Group (MHG), a Portuguese hotel chain with resorts in Lisbon and Algarve, in **designing a dashboard based on his analysis worksheet**. He had already identified insightful observations through various pivot tables, and my goal was to bring the data to life through an explanatory dashboard.

**Data Source**:<br>
The data used is fictional and sourced from the *"Hotel Booking Demand", written by Nuno Antonio, Ana Almeida, and Luis Nunes for Data in Brief, Volume 22, February 2019*. It contains the hotel booking data, from July 2015 to August 2017
